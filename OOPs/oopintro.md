### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
OOP is a programming paradigm centered on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods to manipulate that data. Java is an object-oriented language, meaning it uses OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

1. **Classes and Objects**
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields/attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class can have.
   - **Object**: An instance of a class with specific values assigned to its properties. It represents a real-world entity and interacts with other objects.

   ```java
   // Example of a class
   class Car {
       String color;
       int year;

       void startEngine() {
           System.out.println("Engine started.");
       }
   }

   // Creating an object
   Car myCar = new Car();
   ```



### **Advantages of OOP**
   - **Modularity**: Code is organized in classes, making it modular and easy to maintain.
   - **Reusability**: Use of inheritance and interfaces enables code reuse.
   - **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows for flexible code design.
   - **Scalability**: Easier to expand and modify code without affecting other parts.

These concepts form the foundation of OOP in Java, making the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
