### **1. Packages Example**
   - **Packages** in Java are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, preventing naming conflicts and allowing for easier code management.
   - Java has two types of packages:
     - **Built-in Packages**: Predefined packages like `java.util`, `java.io`.
     - **User-defined Packages**: Custom packages created by users.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     package mypackage; // Defines a user-defined package
     
     public class MyClass {
         public void display() {
             System.out.println("Hello from MyClass");
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **2. Java Packages**
   - Packages act as containers for related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages, helping to prevent conflicts.
   - Using packages helps manage large codebases by grouping similar classes together.
   - **Syntax to define a package**:
     ```java
     package packagename;
     ```

---

### **3. "import" Statement**
   - The `import` statement allows you to bring in other packages, classes, or interfaces, so you can access them without fully qualifying their names.
   - You can import specific classes or entire packages:
     - Import a specific class:
       ```java
       import java.util.Scanner;
       ```
     - Import all classes in a package:
       ```java
       import java.util.*;
       ```

---

### **4. Static Elements Example**
   - Static elements belong to the class rather than to any individual instance. They are shared among all instances of the class.
   - Static elements include **static variables**, **static methods**, and **static blocks**.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class Counter {
         static int count = 0; // static variable

         Counter() {
             count++; // increments the count every time an object is created
         }

         static void displayCount() { // static method
             System.out.println("Count: " + count);
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **5. "static" in Java**
   - The `static` keyword in Java indicates that a particular member belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of that class.
   - Static members are shared across all instances of the class.
   - **Common Uses of `static`**:
     - Static variables: Class-wide variables shared by all instances.
     - Static methods: Methods that can be called without an object of the class.
     - Static blocks: Code that runs once when the class is loaded.

---

### **6. Static Variable Meaning**
   - A **static variable** is shared by all instances of a class.
   - Static variables are created at the time of class loading and remain in memory until the class is unloaded.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class Counter {
         static int count = 0; // static variable

         Counter() {
             count++;
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Counter c1 = new Counter();
             Counter c2 = new Counter();
             System.out.println(Counter.count); // Output: 2
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **7. Non-static Member Inside a Static**
   - Static methods cannot directly access non-static members (variables or methods) because they belong to instances, not to the class itself.
   - **Solution**: You must create an instance of the class or pass an instance to access non-static members within a static method.

---

### **8. Static Member Inside a Non-static**
   - Non-static methods can access static members directly, as static members belong to the class itself and are available to all instances.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class Example {
         static int staticVar = 10;

         void display() {
             System.out.println(staticVar); // Accessing static variable inside a non-static method
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **9. "this" Keyword Inside Static**
   - The `this` keyword cannot be used within static methods or static blocks, as `this` refers to the current instance, and static methods do not belong to any specific instance.

---

### **10. Initialization of Static Variables**
   - Static variables can be initialized:
     - At the time of declaration.
     - Inside a **static block**.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class Example {
         static int staticVar;

         static {
             staticVar = 10; // Static block initialization
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **11. Inner Classes**
   - An **inner class** is a class defined within another class. Inner classes have access to the members (including private members) of the enclosing class.
   - Types of inner classes:
     - **Static nested class**: A static class inside another class.
     - **Non-static nested class** (inner class): A non-static class inside another class.
     - **Local class**: Defined inside a method.
     - **Anonymous class**: A class without a name.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class Outer {
         class Inner { // Non-static inner class
             void display() {
                 System.out.println("Inside Inner class");
             }
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Outer outer = new Outer();
             Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
             inner.display();
         }
     }
     ```

### **12. Internal Working of Some Statements**
   - Java statements like **variable declarations**, **object creation**, and **method calls** each have specific internal workings:
     - **Variable declarations**: Define a variable's type and name, reserving memory for primitives or storing a reference for objects.
     - **Object creation**: Uses `new` to allocate memory on the heap and returns a reference stored on the stack.
     - **Method calls**: Store arguments and method data in the call stack, using a stack frame for local variables during execution.

---

### **13. Singleton Class**
   - A **Singleton class** in Java allows only one instance of itself to be created, providing a global access point.
   - Commonly used in cases where a single resource or shared resource is needed across multiple parts of a program (e.g., logging).
   - **Implementation**:
     ```java
     class Singleton {
         private static Singleton instance; // Single instance

         private Singleton() {} // Private constructor

         public static Singleton getInstance() {
             if (instance == null) {
                 instance = new Singleton();
             }
             return instance;
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Singleton single = Singleton.getInstance();
         }
     }
     ```
